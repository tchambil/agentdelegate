# agentdelegate
introduction agent of web servers
it's copy of https://github.com/jack-krupansky-BT/Agent-Server-Stage-0

the idea is contribute and improve "Agent-Server-Stage-0", with framework "spring boot" (http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/)  and run directly from RESTFUL. For the  delegation of tasks between web servers
For install
execute from terminal: java -jar agent-rest-1.0.jar
For start agent
http://localhost:8080/status/start
will show {"message":"Welcome to Agent Server"}
then we can follow the original instrutions of https://github.com/jack-krupansky-BT/Agent-Server-Stage-0/blob/master/doc/tutorial.txt
but replacing "http://localhost:8980/API/v0.1/" for http://localhost:8080/
